## Technical Implementation

### Audio Processing

The tuner uses the Web Audio API for real-time audio processing:
- `AudioContext` for audio processing
- `AnalyserNode` for frequency analysis
- Zero-crossing detection for pitch identification
- Real-time waveform visualization using SVG

### Tuning Configurations

Each tuning preset includes:
- Note names (e.g., E2, A2, D3)
- Precise frequencies in Hz
- Appropriate frequency ranges for detection

### Theme Management

The application implements a theme system that:
- Persists theme preference
- Provides smooth transitions between themes
- Ensures proper contrast in both modes
- Properly styles all UI components
